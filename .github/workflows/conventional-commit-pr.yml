            ⚠️ Warning ⚠️
            We require pull request titles to follow a subset of the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.bavaga.com/blog/2025/01/27/my-ultimate-conventional-commit-types-cheatsheet/). 
            Example:
            ```
              feat(partner): [JIRA-1234] Add Button component
              ^       ^      ^
              |       |      |__ Subject with Jira ticket (required if scope is `webspark`)
              |       |_______ Scope
              |____________ Type
            ```
            We use 3 types: `fix`, `feat`, and `chore`. We also require a scope, which can be either `webspark` or `partner`.
            It looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.
